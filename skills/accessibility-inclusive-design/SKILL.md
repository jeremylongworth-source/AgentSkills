# Accessibility Inclusive Design

## Core Workflow

1. Identify the product surface, audience, platform, assistive technologies, input methods, legal/compliance context, and risk level.
2. Use semantic structure first. Add ARIA only when native semantics cannot express the interaction correctly.
3. Check the experience across keyboard, pointer/touch, screen reader, zoom/reflow, color/contrast, motion, captions/audio alternatives, and error recovery.
4. Separate automated checks from human judgment. Automated tools catch some issues; they do not prove accessibility.
5. Prioritize blockers that prevent task completion, then issues that create confusion, fatigue, or exclusion.
6. Verify fixes in the actual interface and target states.

## Freshness Rule

Verify current W3C/WAI WCAG guidance and platform accessibility documentation before giving compliance-sensitive advice. WCAG 2.2 is the current W3C recommendation for maximizing future applicability, but legal requirements vary by jurisdiction and this skill is not legal advice.

## Accessibility Priorities

- Keyboard: every interactive control is reachable, operable, visible on focus, and ordered logically.
- Semantics: landmarks, headings, labels, buttons, links, forms, tables, lists, and status messages expose correct meaning.
- Screen readers: dynamic updates, dialogs, menus, comboboxes, errors, and live regions are announced appropriately.
- Visual access: color contrast, text size, spacing, reflow, zoom, and non-color signals are handled.
- Motion: animation, parallax, camera shake, flashing, and transitions respect reduced-motion needs.
- Media: captions, transcripts, audio description, and visual alternatives are considered.
- Games: provide remapping, subtitles, visual audio cues, difficulty assists, readable UI, pause options, and avoid audio-only critical signals unless intentional.

## Deliverable Shape

For accessibility work, provide:

- Surface and user task
- Applicable standard or target quality bar
- Findings by severity
- Evidence and affected users
- Recommended fixes
- Verification steps
- Remaining compliance or legal uncertainty
