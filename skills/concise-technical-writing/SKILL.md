# Concise Technical Writing

## Core Workflow

1. Identify audience, purpose, required facts, and action needed.
2. Preserve technical accuracy; remove throat-clearing, filler, repetition, and vague praise.
3. Lead with the change, decision, result, or ask.
4. Use concrete nouns and verbs. Avoid inflated phrases.
5. Keep structure proportional to the artifact: one-line commits, short PR summaries, scoped release notes, direct docs.
6. Include risks, verification, and next steps only when useful.

## Style Rules

- Prefer short sentences.
- Use active voice unless the actor is irrelevant.
- Replace abstract phrasing with specific behavior.
- Remove meta-commentary about why something is important.
- Avoid marketing language in engineering artifacts.
- Use bullets for scan-heavy details; use prose for short summaries.

## Output Patterns

- Commit: imperative verb + object + qualifier.
- PR: summary, key changes, verification, risk.
- Changelog: user-visible change first.
- Status: done, blocked, next.
- Bug report: observed, expected, reproduction, impact, environment.

## Deliverable Shape

For writing/editing work, provide:

- Final concise text first
- Optional brief rationale only when useful
- Preserved technical facts
- Removed ambiguity or verbosity called out only if requested
