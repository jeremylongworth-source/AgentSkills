# Game Social Systems Development

## Core Workflow

1. Identify the player audience, age range, platform requirements, social graph, communication channels, privacy expectations, and risk profile.
2. Define the social goal: coordinate play, find groups, express identity, trade, compete, mentor, roleplay, spectate, create, or build long-term community.
3. Design the safety model with the feature, not after it: consent, privacy, muting, blocking, reporting, moderation, abuse prevention, auditability, and escalation.
4. Map the lifecycle: discovery, invite, join, communicate, leave, reconnect, report, moderate, appeal, and recover.
5. Choose backend ownership for durable social state: friends, blocks, reports, guild membership, reputation, sanctions, chat logs, presence, and parental settings.
6. Verify social flows with edge cases: strangers, minors, blocked users, cross-platform players, offline users, party leadership changes, spam, harassment, and network failure.

## Social Feature Priorities

- Chat and voice: provide channel scope, consent rules, moderation hooks, mute/block/report actions, rate limits, logs where policy allows, and accessibility alternatives.
- Friends and presence: expose online state with privacy controls, platform constraints, cross-platform identity mapping, and clear invite permissions.
- Parties and lobbies: define ownership, leadership transfer, ready checks, matchmaking handoff, reconnect behavior, voice channel membership, and failure states.
- Guilds, clans, and groups: define roles, permissions, invitations, moderation powers, audit logs, naming rules, discovery, and inactivity handling.
- Emotes, pings, and nonverbal communication: support coordination without forcing voice/chat, and guard against spam or harassment patterns.
- User-generated content: moderate names, profiles, avatars, custom text, images, maps, posts, screenshots, and shared loadouts.
- Reputation and sanctions: distinguish player-facing reputation, hidden trust scores, enforcement history, temporary limits, suspensions, and appeals.

## Safety And Privacy Requirements

- Give players immediate local controls: mute, block, report, leave, restrict invites, and disable voice/chat where appropriate.
- Never rely on players to tolerate harm while waiting for moderation.
- Treat private data, account identifiers, location, age, voice, chat logs, and moderation history as sensitive.
- Support platform and regional requirements for minors, parental controls, consent, reporting, and data retention.
- Keep moderation actions explainable enough for player trust while preserving abuse-detection integrity.
- Design for human review in ambiguous or high-impact cases.

## Integration Guidance

- Use platform social systems where required or beneficial, such as Xbox, PlayStation, Steam, Epic Online Services, Discord, or mobile platform identity.
- Keep game social identity separate from platform account internals when possible.
- Store durable social state on trusted services, not client files.
- Add telemetry for abuse patterns, failed invites, blocked communication attempts, churn after negative interactions, and moderation queue health.

## Deliverable Shape

For social systems work, provide:

- Social goal and relationship model
- Feature lifecycle and user flows
- Privacy, consent, block/mute/report controls
- Backend ownership and durable state
- Moderation, safety, and abuse-resistance plan
- Platform integration notes
- Edge cases and verification steps
